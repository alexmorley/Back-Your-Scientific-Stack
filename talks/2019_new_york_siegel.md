[Introduce myself, why I work on this ...] ended up going to med school wanting to find out how this magic works.

When I was there, I quickly learned that a) we don’t have a clue how antidepressants work and b) they don’t work all that well for a whole lot of people. When I started my PhD it hit me pretty hard that there were so many people researching this stuff, but that we weren’t moving anywhere. Although some of the research techniques were advanced, the way we were communicating and sharing our science isn’t matched up to the task we have of trying to understand the brain.

There are a whole bunch of places in research where incentives are mis-aligned with quality. Today I’m going to talk about software. There’s been a big cultural shift over the last few years with scientists sharing their software, but there is still relatively little re-use. 

In my mind, this is largely because for software to be re-usable it needs both an initial investment, as well as maintenance. And for open software, neither commercial nor current academic incentives are aligned with this requirement.

If you don’t believe me, these are three python packages that in 2017 were used by over 100 million people and they 15 people maintaining them. In 2018 that number went up to 38 … of which 32 are unpaid and 2 are paid full time.

So what I want to show you today is part of a project I am working on to find ways that the funding that is given to researchers to do research can also be used to support the software on which the research critically relies on.

In terms of value for money funding this type of software is a win win as you avoid paying expensive license fees while also supporting the development of software that is of equal or higher quality than commercial solutions and is accessible for the whole scientific community.

So on top of working with funders directly I am building a calculator that estimates the value of a given piece of open source software using the license fees of commercial software with similar feature sets.

This is currently called Back Your Scientific Stack.

Tool Demo.

As well as this I’ve also been working on a few other projects so come chat if you’d like to know about work to combat opaque social media feed algorithms, a new user-interface for jupyter notebooks that was designed for people, and the work I’ve been doing for building a conceptual framework around continuous research aims to automate data and software reuse.
