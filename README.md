# Back-Your-Scientific-Stack

A proposal to emulate, and build upon, the work done by backyourstack.com, in order to inspire recognition and funding for the open source projects that a lot of scientists rely on.

The core goal is to *encourage funders to accept (and grantee's to apply for) donations to open source projects as part of their grant*.

In order to do so we would like to:
- Build a calculator to estimate how much money labs are effectively saving by using free software or open hardware tools over their propriatory equivelants.
- Provide resources and information for small projects looking to be able to receive donations (i.e. how they can get fiscal sponsorship).
- Work directly with funding agencies in the UK to see how this aligns with their current priorities.
- Advocate for open practices as a gold standard in a field (science) where verifiability is key.
